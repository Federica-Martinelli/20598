# CONTRIBUTIONS 

### 15/11/2019
The team is formed, the idea's material is shared among the members and a date for a first team meeting is set

### 18/11/2019
The team meets to narrow down the idea to try and solve the problem of fraud when it comes to private donations to NGOs

### 19/11/2019
The team members work individually and in pairs to a new blockchain that could be used to solve our issue of tracking donations in an immutable way

### 21/11/2019
The team meets to try and implement its own blockchain for this project but then, after talking with the Professor, realizes the best way to address the issue is actually to write a Solidity contract to be deployed on Ethereum. During this meeting the GitHub repository is also setup

### 22/11/2019-24/11/2019
The team members work individually and in pairs to decide which functions to include in the smart contract and start coding it

### 25/11/2019
The team meets with the Professor to outline an initial structure for the contract and it discusses how to solve the issue of checking whether an NGO is actually using the funds for the project it should. The idea of having information miners is created

### 29/11/2019
The team meets to keep on coding the smart contract collaboratively. An example of how to use this contract begins to be coded in Python. Each team member is assigned a different part of the PowerPoint presentation to work on

### 03/12/2019
The team meets on Skype to try and transfer money on Python using web3

### 09/12/2019
The team meets with the Professor to discuss more into detail how to include the vote of the information miners in the contract and also how does the payback work in different situations. The code keeps on getting modified collaboratively. A first draft of the PowerPoint presentation is created and the deliverables are decided: One file for the contract, one file for the example, one PowerPoint presentation, one .txt file containing a timeline of what has been done by the team during the project 

### 10/12/2019-13/12/2019
The members work individually and in group on finishing the remaining tasks. In particular, we highlight that we include a message outputting the amount missing to reach a target for a specific project so that it is not possible to donate more than the goal for a certain project. Moreover, we take care of how to convert a deadline from number of days to number of blocks
