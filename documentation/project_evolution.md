# PROJECT EVOLUTION

The main steps that were taken to create the final smart contract are the following:

1.  __Creation of the virtual environment and installation of all necessary packages and software__:

*  This step consisted mainly in finding the best way to deploy a contract on a local chain so as to be able to test it on the language the project team was most used to: Python. 
*  Initial tests were made on the `infura.io` server host with `MetaMask chrome extension` for ease of multiple computer contributions.
*  The project contract deployment was then transferred for final tests and sample run notebook to `Ganache` to profit from multiple testing wallets. 
*  The main package used to interact with the contract was the `Web3 package` available on multiple programming languages (here python).
