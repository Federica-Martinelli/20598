# 20598 - FinTech for NGOs

## Getting Started
For this university project we implemented a smart contract with the aim of applying blockchain technology to the NGO world.
The main purpose is to combat fraud and increase people's trust in NGOs.

The key aspect of the contract is its immutable mission, location, goal and deadline once deployed as well as the presence of a consensus-based payment function as a safety feature to combat embezzlement.
