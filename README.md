# 20598 - FinTech for NGOs

## Getting Started
For this university project we implemented a smart contract with the aim of applying blockchain technology to the NGO world.
The main purpose is to combat fraud and increase people's trust in NGOs.

The key aspect of the contract is its immutable mission, location, goal and deadline once deployed as well as the presence of a consensus-based payment function as a safety feature to combat embezzlement.

The code is contained in a Jupyter Notebook

## Prerequisites
If you desire to run the notebook you will need to open a Ganache application to simulate different ether wallets. 
You will also need to adjust keys and server urls.
Additionally, the coinapi key is the free version and only allows for 100 requests per day, if passed, please retrieve your own free key on the website: https://www.coinapi.io/
